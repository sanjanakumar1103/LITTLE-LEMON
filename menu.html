                    <h2>Pizza Margherita</h2>
                    <p>The Margherita pizza needs little introduction. The pizza is somewhat of a national dish of Italy, which is fitting considering it was patriotically invented in honor of Queen Margherita in 1889. Its three toppings even represent the Italian flag, with white mozzarella, green basil leaves, and red tomato. It goes without saying that the Margherita pizza is one of the most iconic dishes in all of the Mediterranean countries.

                        Margherita pizza served the Mediterranean way, is uncut and eaten with a knife and fork. Like most of the famous Mediterranean recipes, though, the Margherita pizza and its eating etiquette have been adapted worldwide – so you’ll find this varies depending on where you try the dish. The crispy dough and gooey cheese are a winning combination. You won’t struggle to sample a Margherita pizza wherever you go.</p>

                    <h2>Tabouli</h2>
                    <p>Tabouli is a flavorsome dish from the Middle East known for its intense, delicious flavors. The salad dish is a dense mixture of finely cut fresh parsley, mint, and bulgur wheat, drenched in lemon juice and olive oil and mixed with tomatoes. It is one of the best dishes that includes whole grains and is typically eaten as a mezze dish. However, tabouli in a piece of pita bread is lunch in itself.

                        Tabouli originated in Lebanon and Syria and is a staple salad in an Eastern Mediterranean diet. Tabouli has been around for a long time; experts think it could trace back to the Middle Ages. The dish packs a punch and quickly became famous for its zesty taste and health benefits. You can recreate the salad at home, but sampling it in Lebanon or a local restaurant would be the best way to try it. Luckily, you won’t have to look far since Lebanese cuisine has become widely popular around the globe.</p>

                    <h2>Shakshuka</h2>
                    <p>Shakshuka is a simple one-pot recipe from North Africa and one of the most traditional dishes in Mediterranean cuisine. The dish is quickly recognized by its poached eggs. It is uniquely baked by mixing a tomato sauce (with extra ripe tomatoes) with spices, fresh herbs, and extra virgin olive oil. The eggs are poached by pouring them directly into the mixture and serve as the final decorative touches.

                        The dish is thought to have originated in the 16th century, and many people believe that it was a Tunisian creation. It became quickly popular for being low-cost, healthy, and super easy to make since it only required one pot. Shakshuka is a fun recipe to try at home and is designed to be enjoyed in a family environment.</p>

                    <h2>Falafel</h2>
                    <p>Chances are, you’ve heard of falafel. The little patties are a hugely popular Middle Eastern dish. In fact, they are so popular that they’ve spread out across the world, past other Mediterranean countries, and into countries like the USA and UK. Falafel is considered a vegetarian alternative to traditional meat dishes like kebabs. However, in the Mediterranean, the dish is eaten as part of a mezze.

                        Falafel is made from ground chickpeas and often broad beans. Crushed into little ball shapes, the falafels are then deep-fried and served in a group. A collection of bite-sized falafels are perfect for snacking or eating a mezze platter. And while their history is disputed, the general consensus is that falafels originated in Egypt. Some records suggest that falafel was eaten as far back as Ancient Egypt and the Roman era.</p>

                    <img src="/Images/Paella.jpeg" alt="Paella">
                    <h2>Paella</h2>
                    <p>Paella, who doesn’t know and love this dish? This is one of the most famed Mediterranean recipes and originates from Spain. Seafood is a massive part of the Mediterranean diet, and paella caters to seafood lovers. The dish consists of short-grained rice cooked in a risotto style with stock and tomato-based sauce, with seafood like prawns, mussels, and even octopus accompanying it. Peas and a slice of lemon are usually served with paella, and you might also find vegetables added to the dish.

                        Paella was created in Valencia around the 10th century. It gets its name from the pan it is cooked in, which is shallow to allow the rice to cook in a thin layer. Paella was popular for using up leftover rice and also for serving large groups of people at celebrations and gatherings. It remains a social dish, and its big serving size is perfect for sharing.</p>

                    <h2>Mediterranean Wine</h2>
                    <p>The Mediterranean area is revered for its wine production. The region has the perfect climate to produce local wines. It is considered one of the most versatile wine regions in the world. Italy, Spain, and Southern France are well known for their wines. While each country has cultural differences in wine etiquette and production, wine is a wonderful part of all Mediterranean culture.

                        Wine has been produced for thousands of years, and exactly where it was created remains a hot topic. What we do know, though, is that it was drunk frequently in Ancient Rome and in countries like Georgia as far back as 9000 BC. Nowadays, Mediterranean wine is one of the most exported goods from the region, and wine tasting is a highly sought-after activity in many Mediterranean countries.</p>

                    <img src="/Images/Risotto.jpeg" alt="Risotto">
                    <h2>Risotto</h2>
                    <p>Risotto is a hearty, salt-of-the-earth type of Mediterranean food. The Mediterranean diet contains a lot of carbohydrates, and rice is a popular ingredient. Risotto is a creamy, thick rice dish slowly cooked in a vegetable or meat stock broth. Typically, the rice is cooked briefly in butter to give it a rich, buttery flavor. It is then slowly cooked in broth, added bit by bit to allow as much flavor absorption as possible. To finish, grated parmesan is the ultimate final touch.

                        Risotto originated in Northern Italy, and cookbooks dating back to the 18th century show risotto recipe adaptations. If you visit Italy, risotto is one of the best traditional Italian foods to sample. And if you want to master a staple dish at home, risotto is a rewarding dish to learn to cook. Just be prepared to practice your patience in adding the broth in such tiny amounts. Slow and steady wins the race.</p>

                    <h2>Caldo Verde</h2>
                    <p>Caldo Verde is a medicinal dish in Mediterranean cuisine. The soup packs a super health punch with kale, cabbage, onion, garlic, and a dash of olive oil. It comes in a green color that even looks healthy and is a popular soup when you are unwell and for celebrations as a light meal. It is usually served alongside rye bread and is excellent for dipping.

                        Caldo Verde is a Portuguese soup that was invented in the Minho Province in the 15th century. The delicious soup has been adapted a little over the years but has essentially stayed the same. You might find that different people have their own versions of the recipe in Portugal, as it is such a household dish.</p>

                    <h2>Caprese Salad</h2>
                    <p>A Caprese salad is another classic Mediterranean food. Simple but mouthwateringly delicious, this Italian creation consists of salted sliced tomatoes and mozzarella arranged in an ornate circle on a serving plate. Basil leaves are scattered over the dish, and quite often, you’ll have balsamic vinegar and extra virgin olive oil drizzled over the salad.

                        Like the Margherita pizza, a Caprese salad is a patriotic dish and contains the three colors of the Italian flag. This patriotic importance is central to its creation story, as it was made in 1920 in post-World War 1 Italy. This dish was served at the Hotel Quisisana, and it spread across Italy very quickly as a new favorite dish.
                        
                        A Caprese salad is easy to replicate at home, and you don’t need to travel all the way to Capri to try it (although if you can, you definitely should). It is a refreshing, healthy light snack – perfectly enjoyed mid-afternoon on a summer’s day.</p>
